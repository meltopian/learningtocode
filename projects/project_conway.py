# Typically two arrays are used, one to hold the current generation
# and one in which to calculate its successor.
# For outside the array, the easiest way to program it is 
# to assume that every cell outside the array is dead
# You could also have the sides and top/bottom connect pacman style
# 

# x = 3
# y = 3
# grid = [" "] * (x * y)
# print(grid)

'''
---What to do--
If line 1 starts with '#', ignore (add more rules later)
Use line 2 to create x and y variables
Use x and y variables to create an array (x * y)
Fill array using line 3
Print array as ascii text
'''

def load_conway(array):
    
    pass




#C This is a glider.
x = 3, y = 3
bo$2bo$3o!
